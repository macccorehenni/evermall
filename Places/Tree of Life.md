# Tree of Life
## Initial Description
At the very heart of Evermall stands an ancient and luminous tree, a towering anomaly that defies nature itself. It is said that this tree is the sole reason Evermall exists at all, its golden light stretching across the entire expanse of [[Beginnings]], casting an eternal glow that never fades. Unlike any ordinary plant, this tree did not take years or centuries to reach its immense height—it sprouted from a single seed and grew to full maturity in just one week.

But its presence is no mere coincidence. It is evidence of an unseen force at work, something powerful and deliberate. Whatever—or whoever—trapped these humans here did not simply abandon them to their fate. The tree’s endless radiance ensures that the people of Evermall have what they need to survive. It nurtures the land, provides warmth, and staves off the darkness beyond. It is a prison, yes, but not a desolate one.

The question remains: is this tree a gift, a tool of control, or a warning? And if it was planted with purpose, what exactly does that purpose serve?
