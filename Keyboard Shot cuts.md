# Keyboard shortcuts
These keyboard shortcuts are done in Emacs style:
- C is control
- M is Meta (ie on my keyboard, Alt)
- and S is Super (which won't be used, since that is the Win key)
## Hit in sequence (Doubleshift or Chorded Sequence)
- TAB TAB— Opens Blink
- C C— Toggles all chrome (sidebar, toolbar, property fold, menubar)
- M M— opens command pallet
- S S— opens Settings
## make.md
- C-0 or TAB TAB— opens Blink, a minimal alternative to the Quick Switcher
- C-BACK— closes any extraeneous tabs to the active note
