# CS1— The beginnings
Evermall is a giant mall that seems to be hiding some _giant_ secrets. No one knows how it got to where it was. It just suddenly appeared. Once people got invested in this mall, they suddenly found themselves lost. But as they did, according to legend, they suddenly found more space. It was obvious that this mall didn't want them to leave. They [[Covenant| started]] what was to become… **Evermall**. The [[Tree of Life]] was thus planted, and began to sprout within the hour. Within the week, it had grown to its current size. As it did, the mall decided to stop growing.
