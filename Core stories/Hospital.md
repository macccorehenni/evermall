# CS3— Finding of the [[Places/Needs/Hospital|Hospital]]
## Discovery
The [[Places/Needs/Hospital|Hospital]] was discovered after the founding of the government. Fearing any time dialation, the date system had been reset, from the time the [[Covenant]] was formed. Thusly, on the first day of March, year 0, the hospital had been found. All fifty of the residents had been out in what they then called the [[Places/Regions/Outer Bends|Outer Bends]].  It just appeared, according to several contempory reports. It had been sudden, as it seems so far the Split was keen to keep the case.
## Naming
At the first meeting of the Council after this discovery, they decided to name it the Charmer Hospital. The reason for this was the one who discovered it was quite charming; the first person to return was the first ever [[Covenant#Executive Authority|mayor]] to lead Evermall. He was most obviously charming (otherwise how would )
