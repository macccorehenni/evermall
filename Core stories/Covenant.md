# CS2— Covenant of the Evermall, the Colony of the Mysterious Mall
## Preamble
In recognition of the extraordinary and unexplained circumstances that have led to our confinement within this structure, hereinafter referred to as the "Mall," we, the undersigned, acknowledge the necessity of establishing a sovereign governing body. All attempts at external communication have failed, effectively severing our prior affiliations. Accordingly, we declare our intent to govern ourselves under the principles and provisions set forth in this document.  

## Declaration of Sovereignty
Whereas we have been forcibly separated from the external world by an unidentified and unassailable force, hereinafter referred to as the "Split," we assert our independence from the nation of Danae. The Mall has exhibited autonomous growth and development, precluding any possibility of return. In recognition of these unique conditions, we hereby establish a new political entity, to be known as Evermall, formally designated as the Colony of the Mysterious Mall.  

## Legal Framework
Unless and until amended in accordance with the procedures set forth herein, all laws and regulations in effect within Danae at the time of our separation shall remain binding upon the inhabitants of Evermall.  

### Amendments
This document may be amended by a majority vote of both the Council and the judiciary, with final ratification by the Mayor. Proposed amendments must be submitted in writing and made publicly available for no fewer than fourteen (14) days before a vote may be held.  

### Governmental Structure
#### Seat of Government
The official seat of government shall be the structure constructed by the Split in proximity to the Tree of Life[^1].  

#### Executive Authority
The executive authority of Evermall shall be vested in a Mayor, elected biennially by a majority vote of the populace. The Mayor shall possess the authority to enact and enforce laws, subject to the limitations prescribed herein.  

#### Legislative Authority
A governing Council, consisting of five members[^2] elected biennially by the populace, shall be responsible for drafting and proposing legislation. No law shall take effect without the Mayor’s approval, except in cases where a majority of the Council (defined as no fewer than three members) votes to override a mayoral veto.  
#### Council meetings

The Council shall convene on a biweekly basis at a designated meeting place before the Tree of Life. The agenda for each session shall be formally established and publicly posted no fewer than three days prior to the scheduled assembly.

#### Judicial Authority
A judiciary, comprising six judges elected biennially by the populace, shall be established to adjudicate disputes, hear grievances against the Mayor, and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. Any resident of Evermall shall have the right to petition the judiciary for redress of grievances.  

## Expansion and Population Regulation

### Expansion of the Mall
The Mall and the Split have demonstrated the capacity for autonomous expansion. As new areas emerge, all newly incorporated land shall be subject to systematic parcelization and zoning regulations as determined by the governing authorities. The Council, in conjunction with the Mayor, shall establish a framework for land use, ensuring orderly development and equitable distribution of resources.  

### Regulation of Population Growth
Given the anomalous nature of residency within the Mall, all individuals who appear within its boundaries, hereinafter referred to as "New Arrivals," shall be subject to temporary detainment for identification, orientation, and processing. This measure is necessary to ensure the safety and stability of the City. The procedures for detainment, release, and integration shall be established by the Council and enforced by the governing authorities.  

### Maintenance of Public Order
To preserve peace and ensure the well-being of all residents, civility and mutual respect shall be upheld as fundamental principles of the City. Any individual found in violation of established laws or engaging in conduct detrimental to the community may be subject to detainment through judicial authority. The judiciary shall have the exclusive power to authorize detainment beyond initial processing, ensuring due process for all residents. The Council may establish further provisions regarding conduct and enforcement mechanisms in accordance with this principle.  

## Establishment of Committees
By majority vote, the Mayor and Council may establish additional committees in service of the public interest. Any newly proposed committee shall be subject to confirmation in the next scheduled election[^3].  
## Reckoning of Time
Henceforth, the Gregorian calendar shall be reset, establishing the current day as the first of Year Zero. All dates shall be recorded in accordance with this new reckoning.
## Arbitiation of the Covenent
The judiciary may, upon complaint, change any part of this Covenent without amendment, provided that any modifications are consistent with a majority vote of the citizens of the Mall, and will need a unianomus vote from the judges.
## Conclusion
In acknowledgment of the unprecedented and unexplained circumstances that have led to the confinement of its inhabitants, this Covenant establishes Evermall as a sovereign entity within the Mysterious Mall. Recognizing the failure of external communication and the autonomous expansion of the Mall, the residents declare their independence from the nation of Danae and resolve to govern themselves under the provisions set forth herein.


[^1]: This Covenant was drafted and ratified prior to the full maturation of the Tree of Life but after the establishment of the government building herein designated as the Seat of Government. The designation "City Hall" was adopted in a later amendment.  

[^2]: The number of Council members may be amended in accordance with population changes within Evermall.  

[^3]: This provision has been amended to require confirmation at elections held every two years.
